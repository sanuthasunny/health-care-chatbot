a chatbot based on sklearn where you can give a symptom and it will ask you questions and will tell you the details and give some advice.
1. Importing Libraries:
pandas, numpy: Used for data manipulation and numerical operations.
scikit-learn: Used for machine learning models (e.g., DecisionTreeClassifier, SVC), preprocessing (e.g., LabelEncoder), and model validation (cross_val_score).
pyttsx3: Text-to-speech conversion.
re: Regular expressions for pattern matching.
csv: Reading CSV files.
warnings: Suppresses deprecation warnings.
2. Data Preparation:
The script loads training and testing data from CSV files.
The symptoms (features) are separated from the prognosis (target).
The target labels are encoded to numeric values using LabelEncoder.
Data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
3. Model Training:
A DecisionTreeClassifier is trained on the training data.
A cross-validation score is calculated for the decision tree model.
An SVC (Support Vector Classifier) is also trained and evaluated.
4. Text-to-Speech Setup:
pyttsx3 is initialized for converting text to speech, though this is not used in the script’s current flow.
5. Dictionaries and Data Structures:
The script initializes dictionaries to store the severity of symptoms, descriptions of diseases, and recommended precautions.
These dictionaries are populated by reading corresponding CSV files.
6. Symptom Matching and Disease Prediction:
A pattern matching function (check_pattern) is used to match user input with known symptoms.
The decision tree model is used to predict the disease based on symptoms provided by the user.
The sec_predict function makes a secondary prediction based on selected symptoms.
7. Interactive Diagnosis:
The user is prompted to enter symptoms and the duration of their experience.
The decision tree is traversed interactively to match symptoms and predict potential diseases.
The chatbot suggests potential diseases and corresponding precautions.
8. Severity Calculation:
Based on the severity of symptoms and the duration, the script advises whether a doctor consultation is necessary.
9. Output and Recommendations:
The script prints the predicted disease(s), descriptions, and recommended precautions.
10. Final Notes:
The script includes a function to convert the decision tree structure into code for easier traversal based on user inputs.
The chatbot provides a conversational interface for users to interact with and get predictions about their health conditions.
This script provides a basic framework for a healthcare chatbot with machine learning-based disease prediction and a text-to-speech interface. You can further refine it by adding more sophisticated NLP features, improving the model's accuracy, and integrating a more user-friendly interface.

What's my diagnosis?

To make a diagnosis, the chatbot needs some information from you, such as the symptoms you're experiencing and how long you've had them. Here’s how you can interact with the chatbot to get a diagnosis:

Provide Symptoms:

You will be prompted to enter a symptom you're currently experiencing.
The chatbot will try to match your input with known symptoms. If multiple matches are found, you'll be asked to select the one that best fits.
Duration of Symptoms:

After entering your symptoms, you'll be asked how many days you've been experiencing them.
Symptom Confirmation:

Based on the initial symptom, the chatbot may ask if you’re experiencing other related symptoms.
Diagnosis:

The chatbot will then predict the potential disease(s) based on your inputs.
It will also provide a description of the disease and suggest precautions.
If you'd like to go through this process, I can simulate the chatbot’s behavior here. Just start by telling me a symptom you're experiencing!

Yes, the chatbot you've shared is a combination of rule-based and machine learning-based approaches:

Rule-Based Components:
Symptom Matching:

The chatbot uses regular expressions (re module) to match user-input symptoms with predefined symptoms in its database. This is a rule-based approach where the chatbot checks if the user input matches any known symptom patterns.
Decision Tree Traversal:

The tree_to_code function manually traverses the decision tree based on user inputs. This part involves some rule-based logic to decide which branch of the tree to follow, depending on the symptoms the user reports.
Severity Calculation:

The chatbot uses a set of rules to calculate the severity of the condition based on the severity of symptoms and the duration the user has experienced them.
Machine Learning Components:
Decision Tree Classifier:

The core of the chatbot’s diagnosis is powered by a machine learning model (specifically, a Decision Tree). This model was trained on a dataset to predict diseases based on symptoms.
Secondary Prediction:

The sec_predict function is another machine learning-based prediction that provides a secondary diagnosis using the Decision Tree classifier.
Hybrid Nature:
The chatbot is primarily rule-based when it comes to interacting with the user, gathering symptoms, and managing the flow of the conversation. However, it uses machine learning to make the actual disease predictions based on the symptoms provided.
This hybrid approach combines the interpretability and structured nature of rule-based systems with the flexibility and predictive power of machine learning.
